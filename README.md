# 🧾 Inventory Management System – Backend API (Go + Gin)

A backend-only inventory management system built with Go and the Gin framework. It provides secure RESTful APIs for managing products, orders, and user authentication. Designed for scalability, modularity, and integration with any frontend or third-party system.
